# MariaDB Temporal Tables Demonstration

This repositories contains example for the webinar "MariaDB Temporal Tables: a Demonstration",
by Federico Razzoli, 2023/09/13.

I'm making the examples publicly available not just as helper material for the webinar, but also
for future reference. Even if you didn't attend the webinar, hopefully you'll find some
useful examples and explanations here.

The slides are available here:
